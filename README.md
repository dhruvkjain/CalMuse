## THE BEAUTY IN CHAOS

In this project report, we first explain chaotic systems and chaotic attractors and
explain how chaotic systems can be used as entropy seeds to Physical Unclonable
Functions (PUFs) which act as random number generators for providing musical notes.
We then implement such a random number generator in Python, using Lorenz
Attractor and XOR-Arbiter PUFs and use them to generate random numbers. We
then use the randomly generated numbers to choose notes and then use L systems
for abstract rewriting of those notes. Finally, we use a MIDI writer to translate
the notes into a MIDI file and play it on our website.

## We want to thank Prof. Manish Gupta, for guiding us throughout our project journey and Prof. Mukesh Tiwari for introducing us to Chaotic Systems.
